# Conclusion {#Conclusion}

This paper set out to test whether including higher-order moments in VaR and cVaR would make for more accurate risk management. The starting point for this is that there is a strong body of literature that suggests market returns are leptokurtotic and right-skewed. We choose to focus on daily data and forecast one period ahead, as this is the most relevant for short-term trading desks and the requirement by regulators.
Inspired by Bali, we select 5 different distributions and 5 different GARCH models, for a total of 35 combinations, to estimate VaR and cVaR.  We use  dailydata from the Eurostoxx 50 log return index between 2001 and 2021, a period which includes both major market crises from the 21th century: the Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Our studied distributions are all limiting cases of the Skewed Generalized T-distribution studied by Bali, namely the SGED, GED, ST, T and Normal distribution. To provide some intuition on which distributions most closely match the observed log returns, we performed maximum likelihood estimation and compared the Aikaike Information Criterions to penalize complexity. We found that the SGED distribution is as good as the SGT (due to having one less parameter to estimate, even though it fits the data slightly worse). The normal distribution fits the observed returns the worst, with both the maximum likelihood score and the AIC underperforming the other distributions. This affirms previous literature that the normal distribution is inadequate to model returns.
As a second step we estimate the 7 GARCH models (sGARCH, iGARCH, eGARCH, gjrGARCH, naGARCH, tGARCH and AVGARCH) with the 5 underlying distributions in-sample and again report the AIC. We find that the best model to forecast 1 day returns is the Skewed-T-avGarch. The SGED and Skewed-T distributions generally  are the most performant over all GARCH models. 
In a third step, we report on the parameters of the different GARCH models for these two distributions, and find that the skewness and shape parameters are highly significant, suggesting that indeed higher order moments are relevant for estimating VaR and cVaR. We report the VaR and cVaR at 1% for these distributions, finding that they slightly …
To avoid look-ahead bias as introduced by in-sample estimation, we apply a rolling window technique where we refit every 22	 trading days and forecast 1 trading day. This finds that . Subsequently we compute the VaR and cVaR and compare results for 4 performance tests: the ESTest @Mcneil, Unconditional Coverage test, Conditional Coverage test and Dynamic Quantile test. 
To our knowledge, there is little research on including time-varying moments beyond the variance in (c)VaR estimation. We allow for skewness and shape parameters to vary using an ACD model proposed by @Ghalanos. We compare the results of the 4 performance tests we found before and conclude that allowing higher moments to vary does not improve (c)VaR estimation.

We perform 3 different robustness checks. First, we perform the Jaeque Bera Test on the residuals and find that XXX.  Second, we apply the Ljung-Box test on absolute, and squared residuals of our GARCH models to test for normality. We find that XXX. Second, we perform the ARCH LM test to see if the ARCH process is adequately fitted and find that XXX.
To study the external validity of our research, we also apply our methodology to 3 further datasets: the Eurostoxx 50 Price index (which goes back to 1987), CAC40 return index, BEL20 return index and FTSE100 return index, to estimate if Skewed-t-GARCH and SGED-GARCH are the most efficient models to calculate (c)VaR over a wide range of European markets. We find that XXX. 
Answering the research question “Do higher moments increase accuracy in the estimation of VaR and cVaR?” we answer in the positive, though caution that more model complexity might not always mean better VaR and cVaR estimation. 

Future research (?)
