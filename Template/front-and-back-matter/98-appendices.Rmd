#### Alternatives to the normal distribution {#conditional-distributions}

###### SGT (Skewed Generalized t-distribution) {#sgtinfo}

\noindent The SGT distribution is introduced by @theodossiou1998 and applied by @bali2007 and @bali2008. According to @bali2008 the proposed solutions (use of historical simulation, student's t-distribution, generalized error distribution or a mixture of two normal distributions) to the non-normality of standardized financial returns only partially solved the issues of accounting for skewness and leptokurtosis.The Pdf of the SGT distribition is given by eqution \@ref(eq:sgt). B is the beta function (also called Euler integral).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\begin{array}{c}
f_{S G T}(x ; \mu, \sigma, \xi, \kappa, \eta)=\frac{\kappa}{2 v \sigma \eta^{1 / \kappa} B\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}, \eta\right)\left(\frac{|x-\mu +m|^{\kappa}}{\eta(v \sigma)^{\kappa}(\xi \operatorname{sign}(x-\mu + m)+1)^{\kappa}}+1\right)^{\frac{1}{\kappa}+\eta}} \\ \\ \\ 

m=\frac{2 v \sigma \xi \eta^{\frac{1}{\kappa}} B\left(\frac{2}{\kappa}, \eta-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)}{B\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}, \eta\right)}
\end{array}
\\ \\ \\ 
v=\frac{\eta^{-\frac{1}{\kappa}}}{\sqrt{\left(3 \xi^{2}+1\right) \frac{B\left(\frac{3}{\kappa}, \eta-\frac{2}{\kappa}\right)}{B\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}, \eta\right)}-4 \xi^{2} \frac{B\left(\frac{2}{\kappa}, \eta-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)^{2}}{B\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}, \eta\right)^{2}}}}
\end{array}
(\#eq:sgt)
\end{equation}
```
\noindent Following @theodossiou1998 however, there are two parameters, $\kappa$[^appendices-1]and $\eta$[^appendices-2]) for the shape in the SGT distribution. $\kappa$ is the peakedness parameter. $\eta$ is the tail-thickness parameter. It is equal to the degrees of freedom $\nu$ divided by 2 if $\xi = 0$ and $\kappa = 2$. As shown in the following figure[^appendices-3] \@ref(fig:figure) by Carter Davis, from the SGT the other distributions in the figure are limiting cases of the SGT.

[^appendices-1]: Referred to as $\kappa$ by @theodossiou1998 and @bali2008, but $p$ by Carter Davis in the "sgt" package.

[^appendices-2]: Also referred to as $n$ by @theodossiou1998 and $\eta$ by @bali2008, but $q$ by Carter Davis in the "sgt" packages.

```

###### Student's t-distribution

\noindent A common alternative for the normal distribution is the Student t distribution. Similarly to the normal distribution, it is also symmetric (skewness is equal to zero if $\nu > 3$). The probability density function (pdf), consistent with @ghalanos2020, is given by equation \@ref(eq:stdghalanos). As will be seen in \@ref(vol-mod), GARCH models are used for volatility modeling in practice. @bollerslev1987 examined the use of the GARCH-Student or GARCH-t model as an alternative to the standard Normal distribution, which relaxes the assumption of conditional normality by assuming the standardized innovation to follow a standardized Student t-distribution [@bollerslev2008].

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
f(x; \mu, \sigma,\nu) = \dfrac{\Gamma(\dfrac{\nu+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\dfrac{\nu}{2})\sqrt{\sigma \pi \nu}} \left(1+\dfrac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma \nu}\right)^{-(\nu+1)/2}
 (\#eq:stdghalanos)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\mu, \sigma$ and $\nu$ are respectively the mean, scale and shape (tail-thickness) parameters. $\nu/2$ is equal to the $\eta$[^appendices-4] parameter of the SGT distribution with other restrictions (see part \@ref(sgtinfo)). The symbol $\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.

[^appendices-4]: Also referred to as $n$ by @theodossiou1998 or $q$ by Carter Davis in the "sgt" package.

\noindent Unlike the normal distribution, which depends on two parameters only, the student t distribution allows for fatter tails. This kurtosis coefficient is given by equation \@ref(eq:kurt) if $\nu>4$. This is useful while the standardized residuals of stock returns appear to have fatter tails than the normal distribution following @bollerslev2008.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
kurt = 3 + \dfrac{6}{\nu-4}
 (\#eq:kurt)
\end{align}
```
###### Generalized Error Distribution

\noindent The GED distribution is nested in the generalized t distribution by @mcdonald1988 and is used in the GED-GARCH model by @nelson1991 to model stock market returns. This model replaced the assumption of conditional normally distributed error terms by standardized innovations that following a generalized error distribution. It is a symmetric, uni-modal distribution (location parameter is the mode, median and mean). This is also sometimes called the exponential power distribution [@bollerslev2008]. The conditional density (pdf) is given by equation \@ref(eq:ged) following @ghalanos2020.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
f(x; \mu, \sigma, \kappa) = \dfrac{\kappa e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left|\dfrac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right|^\kappa}}{2^{1+1/\kappa}\sigma\Gamma(1/\kappa)}
 (\#eq:ged)
\end{align}
```
where $\mu, \sigma$ and $\kappa$ are respectively the mean, scale and shape parameters.

###### Skewed t-distribution

\noindent The density function can be derived following @fernández1998 who showed how to introduce skewness into uni-modal standardized distributions [@trottier2015]. The first equation from @trottier2015, here equation \@ref(eq:skeweddist) presents the skewed t-distribution.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
f_{\xi}(z) \equiv \frac{2 \sigma_{\xi}}{\xi+\xi^{-1}} f_{1}\left(z_{\xi}\right), \quad z_{\xi} \equiv\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\xi^{-1}\left(\sigma_{\xi} z+\mu_{\xi}\right) & \text { if } z \geq-\mu_{\xi} / \sigma_{\xi} \\
\xi\left(\sigma_{\xi} z+\mu_{\xi}\right) & \text { if } z<-\mu_{\xi} / \sigma_{\xi}
\end{array}\right.
 (\#eq:skeweddist)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\mu_{\xi} \equiv M_{1}\left(\xi-\xi^{-1}\right), \quad \sigma_{\xi}^{2} \equiv\left(1-M_{1}^{2}\right)\left(\xi^{2}+\xi^{-2}\right)+2 M_{1}^{2}-1, \quad M_{1} \equiv 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} u f_{1}(u) d u$ and $\xi$ between $0$ and $\infty$. $f_1(\cdot)$ is in this case equation \@ref(eq:stdghalanos), the pdf of the student t distribution coming to equation \@ref(eq:stdist), which has the parameterization following the SGT parameters.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}f_{S T}(x ; \alpha, \beta, \xi, \eta)=\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+\eta\right)}{\sqrt{\beta\pi \eta} \Gamma(\eta)\left(\frac{|x-\alpha+m|^{2}}{\eta\beta(\xi \operatorname{sign}(x-\alpha+m)+1)^{2}}+1\right)^{\frac{1}{2}+\eta}} \\ \\ \\ m=\frac{2 \xi \sqrt{\beta\eta} \Gamma\left(\eta-\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi} \Gamma\left(\eta+\frac{1}{2}\right)}\end{array}
 (\#eq:stdist)
\end{equation}
```
\noindent According to @giot2003 as well as @giot2004, the skewed t-distribution outperforms the symmetric density distributions.

###### Skewed Generalized Error Distribution

\noindent A further distribution to analyse is the SGED distribution of @theodossiou2000. It is applied in GARCH models by @lee2008. The SGED distribution extends the Generalized Error Distribution (GED) to allow for skewness and leptokurtosis. The density function can be derived following @fernández1998 who showed how to introduce skewness into uni-modal standardized distributions [@trottier2015]. It can also be found in @theodossiou2000. The pdf is then given by the same equation \@ref(eq:skeweddist) as the skewed t-distribution but with $f_1(\cdot)$ equal to equation \@ref(eq:ged). To then get equation \@ref(eq:sged).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}f_{S G E D}(x ; \mu, \sigma, \xi, \kappa)=\frac{\kappa e^{-\left(\frac{|x-\mu+m|}{v \sigma(1+\xi \operatorname{sig}(x-\mu+m))}\right)^{\kappa}}}{2 \nu \sigma \Gamma(1 / \kappa)} \\ \\ \\ m=\frac{2^{\frac{2}{\kappa}} \nu \sigma \xi \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}} \\ \\ \\ v=\sqrt{\frac{\pi \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)}{\pi\left(1+3 \xi^{2}\right) \Gamma\left(\frac{3}{\kappa}\right)-16^{\frac{1}{\kappa}} \xi^{2} \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)^{2} \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)}}\end{array}(\#eq:sged)
\end{equation}
```
#### ARCH models {#ARCH}
\noindent From the components of the ARCH model described in part \@ref(univ-garch) we could look at the conditional moments (or expected returns and variance). We can plug in the component $\sigma_t$ into the conditional mean innovation $\varepsilon_{t}$ and use the conditional mean innovation to examine the conditional mean return. In equation \@ref(eq:eq4) and \@ref(eq:eq5) they are derived. Because the random variable $z_t$ is distributed with a zero-mean, the conditional expectation is 0. As a consequence, the conditional mean return in equation \@ref(eq:eq5) is equal to the unconditional mean in the most simple case. But variations are possible using ARMA (eg. AR(1)) processes.

```{=tex}
\begin{align} 
\mathbb{E}_{t-1}(\varepsilon_{t}) = \mathbb{E}_{t-1}(\sqrt{\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times  \varepsilon_{t-1}^2} \times z_t) = \sigma_t\mathbb{E}_{t-1}(z_t) = 0
 (\#eq:eq4)
\end{align} 
```
```{=tex}
\begin{align} 
\mathbb{E}_{t-1}(y_{t}) = \alpha_0 + \mathbb{E}_{t-1}(\varepsilon_{t}) = \alpha_0
 (\#eq:eq5)
\end{align}
```
\noindent For the conditional variance, knowing everything that happened until and including period $t-1$ the conditional innovation variance is given by equation \@ref(eq:eq6). This is equal to $\sigma_t^2$, while the variance of $z_t$ is equal to 1. Then it is easy to derive the conditional variance of returns in equation \@ref(eq:eq7), that is why equation \@ref(eq:eq3) is called the variance equation.

```{=tex}
\begin{align} 
var_{t-1}(\varepsilon_t) = \mathbb{E}_{t-1}(\varepsilon_{t}^2) = \mathbb{E}_{t-1}(\sigma_t^2 \times z_t^2) = \sigma_t^2\mathbb{E}_{t-1}(z_t^2) = \sigma_t^2
 (\#eq:eq6)
\end{align} 
```
```{=tex}
\begin{align} 
var_{t-1}(y_t) = var_{t-1}(\varepsilon_t)= \sigma_t^2
 (\#eq:eq7)
\end{align}
```
\noindent The unconditional variance is also interesting to derive, while this is the long-run variance, which will be derived in equation \@ref(eq:eq11). After deriving this using the law of iterated expectations and assuming stationarity for the variance process, one would get equation \@ref(eq:eq8) for the unconditional variance, equal to the constant $\beta_0$ and divided by $1-\beta_1$, the slope of the variance equation.

```{=tex}
\begin{align} 
\sigma^2 = \dfrac{\beta_0}{1-\beta_1}
 (\#eq:eq8)
\end{align}
```
\noindent This leads to the properties of ARCH models: Stationarity[^literature-review-3] condition for variance: $\beta_0>0$ and $0 \le \beta_1 < 1$. But also, zero-mean innovations and uncorrelated innovations. Thus a weak white noise process $\varepsilon_t$. The unconditional 4th moment, kurtosis $\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_t^4)/\sigma^4$ of an ARCH model is given by equation \@ref(eq:eq9). This term is larger than 3, which implicates fat-tails.

[^literature-review-3]: Stationarity implies that the series on which the ARCH model is used does not have any trend and has a constant expected mean. Only the conditional variance is changing.

```{=tex}
\begin{align} 
3\dfrac{1-\beta_1^2}{1-3\beta_1^2}
 (\#eq:eq9)
\end{align}
```
\noindent Another property of ARCH models is that it takes into account volatility clustering. Because we know that $var(\varepsilon_t) = \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_t^2) = \sigma^2 = \beta_0/(1-\beta_1)$, we can plug in $\beta_0$ for the conditional variance $var_t(\varepsilon_{t+1}) = \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_{t+1}^2) = \sigma_{t+1}^2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1\times\varepsilon_t^2$. Thus it follows that equation \@ref(eq:eq10) displays volatility clustering. If we examine the RHS, as $\beta_1>0$ (condition for stationarity), when shock $\varepsilon_t^2$ is larger than what you expect it to be on average $\sigma^2$ the LHS will also be positive. Then the conditional variance will be larger than the unconditional variance. Briefly, large shocks will be followed by more large shocks.

```{=tex}
\begin{align} 
\sigma_{t+1}^2 - \sigma^2 = \beta_1\times(\varepsilon_t^2 - \sigma^2)
 (\#eq:eq10)
\end{align}
```
\noindent Excess kurtosis can be modeled, even when the conditional distribution is assumed to be normally distributed. The third moment, skewness, can be introduced using a skewed conditional distribution as we saw in part \@ref(conditional-distributions). The serial correlation for squared innovations is positive if fourth moment exists (equation \@ref(eq:eq9), this is volatility clustering once again.

\noindent How will then the variance be forecasted? Well, the conditional variance for the $k$-periods ahead , denoted as period $T+k$, is given by equation \@ref(eq:eq11). This can already be simplified, while we know that $\sigma_{T+1}^2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \varepsilon_T^2$ from equation \@ref(eq:eq3).

```{=tex}
\begin{align} 
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}_T(\varepsilon_{T+k}^2) 
&= \beta_0\times(1+\beta_1 + ... + \beta_1^{k-2}) + \beta_1^{k-1}\times\sigma_{T+1}^2 \\
&= \beta_0\times(1+\beta_1 + ... + \beta_1^{k-1}) + \beta_1^{k}\times\sigma_{T}^2
\end{split}
 (\#eq:eq11)
\end{align}
```
\noindent It can be shown that then the conditional variance in period $T+k$ is equal to equation \@ref(eq:eq12). The LHS is the predicted conditional variance $k$-periods ahead above its unconditional variance, $\sigma^2$. The RHS is the difference current last-observed return residual $\varepsilon_T^2$ above the unconditional average multiplied by $\beta_1^k$, a decreasing function of $k$ (given that $0 \le\beta_1 <1$). The further ahead predicting the variance, the closer $\beta_1^k$ comes to zero, the closer to the unconditional variance, i.e. the long-run variance.

```{=tex}
\begin{align} 
\mathbb{E}_T(\varepsilon_{T+k}^2) - \sigma^2 = \beta_1^k\times(\varepsilon_T^2 - \sigma^2)
 (\#eq:eq12)
\end{align}
```

#### GARCH models

All the GARCH models are estimated using the package "rugarch" by @alexios2020. We use specifications similar to @ghalanos2020. Parameters have to be restricted so that the variance output always is positive, except for the EGARCH model, as this model mathematically ensures the output is positive.

###### Symmetric (normal) GARCH model

\noindent The standard GARCH model [@bollerslev1986] is written consistent with @ghalanos2020 as in equation \@ref(eq:eq13) without external regressors.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t^2 = \beta_0  +  {\beta_1}\varepsilon _{t-1}^2 + {\beta_2}\sigma_{t-1}^2
 (\#eq:eq13)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\sigma_t^2$ denotes the conditional variance, $\beta_0$ the intercept and $\varepsilon_t^2$ the residuals from the used mean process. The GARCH order is defined by $(q, p)$ (ARCH, GARCH), which is here $(1, 1)$. As @ghalanos2020 describes: "one of the key features of the observed behavior of financial data which GARCH models capture is volatility clustering which may be quantified in the persistence parameter $\hat{P}$ specified as in equation \@ref(eq:eq14) for a GARCH model of order $(1,1)$.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\hat{P} =  \beta_1  + \beta_2.
 (\#eq:eq14)
\end{align}
```
\noindent The unconditional variance of the standard GARCH model of Bollerslev is very similar to the ARCH model, but with the Garch parameter ($\beta_2$) included as in equation \@ref(eq:eq15).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{\sigma}^2 
&= \dfrac{\beta_0}{1 - \hat{P}} \\
&= \dfrac{\beta_0}{1 - \beta_1 - \beta_2}
\end{split}
 (\#eq:eq15)
\end{equation}
```
###### IGARCH model

\noindent Following @ghalanos2020, the integrated GARCH model [@bollerslev1986] can also be estimated. This model assumes the persistence $\hat{P} = 1$. This is done by Ghalanos, by setting the sum of the ARCH and GARCH parameters to 1. Because of this unit-persistence, the unconditional variance cannot be calculated.

###### GJRGARCH model

\noindent The GJRGARCH model [@glosten1993], which is an alternative for the asymmetric GARCH (AGARCH) by @engle1990 and @engle1993, models both positive as negative shocks on the conditional variance asymmetrically by using an indicator variable $I_t-1$, it is specified as in equation \@ref(eq:eq17).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t^2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1}^2 + \gamma_j I_{t-1} \varepsilon_{t-1}^2 + \beta_2 \sigma_{t-1}^2
 (\#eq:eq17)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\gamma_j$ represents the *leverage* term. The indicator function $I$ takes on value 1 for $\varepsilon \le 0$, 0 otherwise. Because of the indicator function, persistence of the model now crucially depends on the asymmetry of the conditional distribution used according to @ghalanos2020.

###### EGARCH model

\noindent The EGARCH model or exponential GARCH model [@nelson1991] is defined as in equation \@ref(eq:eq16). The advantage of the EGARCH model is that there are no parameter restrictions, since the output is log variance (which cannot be negative mathematically), instead of variance.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\log_e(\sigma_t^2) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 z_{t-1} + \gamma_1 (|z_{t-1}| - E|z_{t-1}|)+ \beta_2 \log_e(\sigma_{t-1}^2)
 (\#eq:eq16)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\beta_1$ captures the sign effect and $\gamma_j$ the size effect.

###### NAGARCH model

\noindent The NAGARCH or nonlinear asymmetric model [@engle1993]. It is specified as in equation \@ref(eq:eq18). The model is *asymmetric* as it allows for positive and negative shocks to differently affect conditional variance and *nonlinear* because a large shock is not a linear transformation of a small shock.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t^2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\varepsilon_{t-1}+ \gamma_1 \sqrt{\sigma_{t-1}})^2 + \beta_2 \sigma_{t-1}^2
 (\#eq:eq18)
\end{align}
```
As before, $\gamma_1$ represents the *leverage* term.

###### TGARCH model

\noindent The TGARCH or threshold model [@zakoian1994] also models asymmetries in volatility depending on the sign of the shock, but contrary to the GJRGARCH model it uses the conditional standard deviation instead of conditional variance. It is specified as in \@ref(eq:eq19).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1^+ \varepsilon_{t-1}^+ - \beta_1^{-} \varepsilon_{t-1}^{-} + \beta_2 \sigma_{t-1}
 (\#eq:eq19)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\varepsilon_{t-1}^+$ is equal to $\varepsilon_{t-1}$ if the term is negative and equal to 0 if the term is positive. The reverse applies to $\varepsilon_{t-1}^-$. They cite @davidian1987 who find that using volatility instead of variance as scaling input variable gives better variance estimates. This is due to absolute residuals (contrary to squared residuals with variance) more closely predicting variance for non-normal distributions.

###### TSGARCH model

\noindent The absolute value Garch model or TS-Garch model, as named after @taylor1986 and @schwert1989, models the conditional standard deviation and is intuitively specified like a normal GARCH model, but with the absolute value of the shock term. It is specified as in \@ref(eq:eq20).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \left|\varepsilon_{t-1}\right| + \beta_2 \sigma_{t-1}
 (\#eq:eq20)
\end{align}
```

###### EWMA

\noindent An alternative to the series of GARCH models is the exponentially weighted moving average or EWMA model. This model calculates conditional variance based on the shocks from previous periods. The idea is that by including a smoothing parameter $\lambda$ more weight is assigned to recent periods than distant periods. The $\lambda$ must be less than 1. It is specified as in \@ref(eq:eq21).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t^2 = (1-\lambda) \sum\limits_{j=1}^\infty (\lambda^j \varepsilon_{t-j}^2)
 (\#eq:eq21)
\end{align}
```
In practice a $\lambda$ of 0.94 is often used, such as by the financial risk management company RiskMetrics$^{TM}$ model of J.P. Morgan [@morganguarantytrustcompany1996].

#### Goodness of fit {#goodness-of-fit}

\noindent As already mentioned, next to testing the models in part \@ref(analysis), we also tested other models using the different distributions. This we did in order to check if distributions that capture the higher moment effects are really better in terms of goodness of fit. We did a small data mining experiment with 140 models that were estimated. This can lead to overfitting because of the fit in-sample. However, we can decide if there is a trend using the different distributions for the several GARCH models. Thus, in this experiment, our rule of thumb was to examine general trends. Six cases were examined.  \

\newpage
\noindent First, in figure \@ref(fig:aic1), symmetric GARCH with symmetric distributions are looked at. As you can see the general error distribution (GED) seems to perform slightly better than the the T distribution. While the student's t distribution (T) performs better than the normal distribution (NORM) according to the AIC. Which is consistent with the literature that found that the assumption of the normal distribution is a rather poor assumption.

```{r aic1, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Goodness of fit symmetric GARCH and distributions', out.width='100%',fig.pos='h', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/aicfigures/symmetric aics.pdf")
```
\clearpage
\newpage
\noindent Second, in figure \@ref(fig:aic2), symmetric GARCH models with the best symmetric distribution (T) and other distributions (SGED, ST) are looked at. As you can see the SGED seems to perform better than the skewed student's t distribution (ST) and the latter is better than the T distribution. This is consistent with @giot2003 that the skewed student's t (ST) distribution outperforms the symmetric distributions.

```{r aic2, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Goodness of fit symmetric GARCH and other distributions', out.width='100%',fig.pos='h', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/aicfigures/symmetric aics2.pdf")
```
\clearpage
\newpage
\noindent In figure \@ref(fig:aic3) you can see the same patter as in figure \@ref(fig:aic1), the student's t distribution performs best among the symmetric distributions.

```{r aic3, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Goodness of fit asymmetric GARCH and symmetric distributions', out.width='100%',fig.pos='h', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/aicfigures/asymmetric aics.pdf")
```

\noindent Then, in figure \@ref(fig:aic4) the same patter arises as in figure \@ref(fig:aic2), the skewed student's t distribution again seems to be the most optimal one to use. Therefore the ST distribution is chosen as final model for the Euro Stoxx 50 index.
```{r aic4, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Goodness of fit asymmetric GARCH and symmetric distributions', out.width='100%',fig.pos='h', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/aicfigures/asymmetric aics2.pdf")
```
\noindent In two additional figures the family garch models (TGARCH, NAGARCH and AVGARCH) are examined, the same patterns were observed as above[^appendices-5].


[^appendices-5]: We have to note that for some models like TGARCH and AVGARCH with SGED distribution the AIC was double of other models and therefore these models seem to work very poorly or are misspecified.
