#### Alternatives to the normal distribution {#conditional-distributions}

###### SGT (Skewed Generalized t-distribution) {#sgtinfo}

\noindent The SGT distribution is introduced by @theodossiou1998 and applied by @bali2007 and @bali2008. According to @bali2008 the proposed solutions (use of historical simulation, student's t-distribution, generalized error distribution or a mixture of two normal distributions) to the non-normality of standardized financial returns only partially solved the issues of accounting for skewness and leptokurtosis.The Pdf of the SGT distribition is given by eqution \@ref(eq:sgt). B is the beta function (also called Euler integral).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
f_{S G T}(x ; \mu, \sigma, \xi, \kappa, \eta)=\frac{\kappa}{2 v \sigma \eta^{1 / \kappa} B\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}, \eta\right)\left(\frac{|x-\mu +m|^{\kappa}}{\eta(v \sigma)^{\kappa}(\xi \operatorname{sign}(x-\mu + m)+1)^{\kappa}}+1\right)^{\frac{1}{\kappa}+\eta}} \\

m=\frac{2 v \sigma \xi \eta^{\frac{1}{\kappa}} B\left(\frac{2}{\kappa}, \eta-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)}{B\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}, \eta\right)}
\end{array}

v=\frac{\eta^{-\frac{1}{\kappa}}}{\sqrt{\left(3 \xi^{2}+1\right) \frac{B\left(\frac{3}{\kappa}, \eta-\frac{2}{\kappa}\right)}{B\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}, \eta\right)}-4 \xi^{2} \frac{B\left(\frac{2}{\kappa}, \eta-\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)^{2}}{B\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}, \eta\right)^{2}}}}
\end{array}
(\#eq:sgt)
\end{equation}
```
\noindent Following @theodossiou1998 however, there are two parameters, $\kappa$[^appendices-1]and $\eta$[^appendices-2]) for the shape in the SGT distribution. $\kappa$ is the peakedness parameter. $\eta$ is the tail-thickness parameter. It is equal to the degrees of freedom $\nu$ divided by 2 if $\xi = 0$ and $\kappa = 2$. As shown in the following figure[^appendices-3] \@ref(fig:figure) adapted by Carter Davis using , from the SGT the other distributions in the figure are limiting cases of the SGT.

[^appendices-1]: Referred to as $\kappa$ by @theodossiou1998 and @bali2008, but $p$ by Carter Davis in the "sgt" package.

[^appendices-2]: Also referred to as $n$ by @theodossiou1998 and $\eta$ by @bali2008, but $q$ by Carter Davis in the "sgt" packages.

```

###### Student's t-distribution

\noindent A common alternative for the normal distribution is the Student t distribution. Similarly to the normal distribution, it is also symmetric (skewness is equal to zero if $\nu > 3$). The probability density function (pdf), consistent with @ghalanos2020, is given by equation \@ref(eq:stdghalanos). As will be seen in \@ref(vol-mod), GARCH models are used for volatility modeling in practice. @bollerslev1987 examined the use of the GARCH-Student or GARCH-t model as an alternative to the standard Normal distribution, which relaxes the assumption of conditional normality by assuming the standardized innovation to follow a standardized Student t-distribution [@bollerslev2008].

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
f(x; \mu, \sigma,\nu) = \dfrac{\Gamma(\dfrac{\nu+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\dfrac{\nu}{2})\sqrt{\sigma \pi \nu}} \left(1+\dfrac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma \nu}\right)^{-(\nu+1)/2}
 (\#eq:stdghalanos)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\mu, \sigma$ and $\nu$ are respectively the mean, scale and shape (tail-thickness) parameters. $\nu/2$ is equal to the $\eta$[^appendices-4] parameter of the SGT distribution with other restrictions (see part \@ref(sgtinfo)). The symbol $\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.

[^appendices-4]: Also referred to as $n$ by @theodossiou1998 or $q$ by Carter Davis in the "sgt" package.

\noindent Unlike the normal distribution, which depends on two parameters only, the student t distribution allows for fatter tails. This kurtosis coefficient is given by equation \@ref(eq:kurt) if $\nu>4$. This is useful while the standardized residuals of stock returns appear to have fatter tails than the normal distribution following @bollerslev2008.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
kurt = 3 + \dfrac{6}{\nu-4}
 (\#eq:kurt)
\end{align}
```
###### Generalized Error Distribution

\noindent The GED distribution is nested in the generalized t distribution by @mcdonald1988 and is used in the GED-GARCH model by @nelson1991 to model stock market returns. This model replaced the assumption of conditional normally distributed error terms by standardized innovations that following a generalized error distribution. It is a symmetric, uni-modal distribution (location parameter is the mode, median and mean). This is also sometimes called the exponential power distribution [@bollerslev2008]. The conditional density (pdf) is given by equation \@ref(eq:ged) following @ghalanos2020.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
f(x; \mu, \sigma, \kappa) = \dfrac{\kappa e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left|\dfrac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right|^\kappa}}{2^{1+1/\kappa}\sigma\Gamma(1/\kappa)}
 (\#eq:ged)
\end{align}
```
where $\mu, \sigma$ and $\kappa$ are respectively the mean, scale and shape parameters.

###### Skewed t-distribution

\noindent The density function can be derived following @fernández1998 who showed how to introduce skewness into uni-modal standardized distributions [@trottier2015]. The first equation from @trottier2015, here equation \@ref(eq:skeweddist) presents the skewed t-distribution.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
f_{\xi}(z) \equiv \frac{2 \sigma_{\xi}}{\xi+\xi^{-1}} f_{1}\left(z_{\xi}\right), \quad z_{\xi} \equiv\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\xi^{-1}\left(\sigma_{\xi} z+\mu_{\xi}\right) & \text { if } z \geq-\mu_{\xi} / \sigma_{\xi} \\
\xi\left(\sigma_{\xi} z+\mu_{\xi}\right) & \text { if } z<-\mu_{\xi} / \sigma_{\xi}
\end{array}\right.
 (\#eq:skeweddist)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\mu_{\xi} \equiv M_{1}\left(\xi-\xi^{-1}\right), \quad \sigma_{\xi}^{2} \equiv\left(1-M_{1}^{2}\right)\left(\xi^{2}+\xi^{-2}\right)+2 M_{1}^{2}-1, \quad M_{1} \equiv 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} u f_{1}(u) d u$ and $\xi$ between $0$ and $\infty$. $f_1(\cdot)$ is in this case equation \@ref(eq:stdghalanos), the pdf of the student t distribution coming to equation \@ref(eq:stdist), which has the parameterization following the SGT parameters.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}f_{S T}(x ; \alpha, \beta, \xi, \eta)=\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+\eta\right)}{\sqrt{\beta\pi \eta} \Gamma(\eta)\left(\frac{|x-\alpha+m|^{2}}{\eta\beta(\xi \operatorname{sign}(x-\alpha+m)+1)^{2}}+1\right)^{\frac{1}{2}+\eta}} \\m=\frac{2 \xi \sqrt{\beta\eta} \Gamma\left(\eta-\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi} \Gamma\left(\eta+\frac{1}{2}\right)}\end{array}
 (\#eq:stdist)
\end{equation}
```
\noindent According to @giot2003; @giot2004, the skewed t-distribution outperforms the symmetric density distributions.

###### Skewed Generalized Error Distribution

\noindent A further distribution to analyse is the SGED distribution of @theodossiou2000. It is applied in GARCH models by @lee2008. The SGED distribution extends the Generalized Error Distribution (GED) to allow for skewness and leptokurtosis. The density function can be derived following @fernández1998 who showed how to introduce skewness into uni-modal standardized distributions [@trottier2015]. It can also be found in @theodossiou2000. The pdf is then given by the same equation \@ref(eq:skeweddist) as the skewed t-distribution but with $f_1(\cdot)$ equal to equation \@ref(eq:ged). To then get equation \@ref(eq:sged).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
f_{S G E D}(x ; \mu, \sigma, \xi, \kappa)=\frac{\kappa e^{-\left(\frac{|x-\mu+m|}{v \sigma(1+\xi \operatorname{sig}(x-\mu+m))}\right)^{\kappa}}}{2 \nu \sigma \Gamma(1 / \kappa)} \\
m=\frac{2^{\frac{2}{\kappa}} \nu \sigma \xi \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}}
\end{array}

v=\sqrt{\frac{\pi \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)}{\pi\left(1+3 \xi^{2}\right) \Gamma\left(\frac{3}{\kappa}\right)-16^{\frac{1}{\kappa}} \lambda^{2} \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)^{2} \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)}}
\end{array}
(\#eq:sged)
\end{equation}
```
#### GARCH models

All the GARCH models are estimated using the package "rugarch" by @alexios2020. We use specifications similar to @ghalanos2020. Parameters have to be restricted so that the variance output always is positive, except for the EGARCH model, as this model mathematically ensures the output is positive.

###### Symmetric (normal) GARCH model

\noindent The standard GARCH model [@bollerslev1986] is written consistent with @ghalanos2020 as in equation \@ref(eq:eq13) without external regressors.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t^2 = \beta_0  +  {\beta_1}\varepsilon _{t-j}^2 + {\beta_2}\sigma_{t-j}^2
 (\#eq:eq13)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\sigma_t^2$ denotes the conditional variance, $\beta_0$ the intercept and $\varepsilon_t^2$ the residuals from the used mean process. The GARCH order is defined by $(q, p)$ (ARCH, GARCH), which is here $(1, 1)$. As @ghalanos2020 describes: "one of the key features of the observed behavior of financial data which GARCH models capture is volatility clustering which may be quantified in the persistence parameter $\hat{P}$ specified as in equation \@ref(eq:eq14) for a GARCH model of order $(1,1)$.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\hat{P} =  \beta_1  + \beta_2.
 (\#eq:eq14)
\end{align}
```
\noindent The unconditional variance of the standard GARCH model of Bollerslev is very similar to the ARCH model, but with the Garch parameter ($\beta_2$) included as in equation \@ref(eq:eq15).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{\sigma}^2 
&= \dfrac{\beta_0}{1 - \hat{P}} \\
&= \dfrac{\beta_1}{1 - \beta_1 - \beta_2}
\end{split}
 (\#eq:eq15)
\end{equation}
```
###### IGARCH model

\noindent Following @ghalanos2020, the integrated GARCH model [@bollerslev1986] can also be estimated. This model assumes the persistence $\hat{P} = 1$. This is done by Ghalanos, by setting the sum of the ARCH and GARCH parameters to 1. Because of this unit-persistence, the unconditional variance cannot be calculated.

###### GJRGARCH model

\noindent The GJRGARCH model [@glosten1993], which is an alternative for the asymmetric GARCH (AGARCH) by @engle1990 and @engle1993, models both positive as negative shocks on the conditional variance asymmetrically by using an indicator variable $I_t-j$, it is specified as in equation \@ref(eq:eq17).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t^2 = \beta_0 + \alpha_1 \varepsilon_{t-1}^2 + \gamma_j I_{t-1} \varepsilon_{t-1}^2 + \beta_2 \sigma_{t-1}^2
 (\#eq:eq17)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\gamma_j$ represents the *leverage* term. The indicator function $I$ takes on value 1 for $\varepsilon \le 0$, 0 otherwise. Because of the indicator function, persistence of the model now crucially depends on the asymmetry of the conditional distribution used according to @ghalanos2020.

###### EGARCH model

\noindent The EGARCH model or exponential GARCH model [@nelson1991] is defined as in equation \@ref(eq:eq16). The advantage of the EGARCH model is that there are no parameter restrictions, since the output is log variance (which cannot be negative mathematically), instead of variance.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\log_e(\sigma_t^2) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 z_{t-1} + \gamma_1 (|z_{t-1}| - E|z_{t-1}|)+ \beta_2 \log_e(\sigma_{t-j}^2)
 (\#eq:eq16)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\alpha_j$ captures the sign effect and $\gamma_j$ the size effect.

###### NAGARCH model

\noindent The NAGARCH or nonlinear asymmetric model [@engle1993]. It is specified as in equation \@ref(eq:eq18). The model is *asymmetric* as it allows for positive and negative shocks to differently affect conditional variance and *nonlinear* because a large shock is not a linear transformation of a small shock.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t^2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\varepsilon_{t-1}+ \gamma_1 \sqrt{\sigma_{t-1}})^2 + \beta_2 \sigma_{t-1}^2
 (\#eq:eq18)
\end{align}
```
As before, $\gamma_1$ represents the *leverage* term.

###### TGARCH model

\noindent The TGARCH or threshold model [@zakoian1994] also models asymmetries in volatility depending on the sign of the shock, but contrary to the GJRGARCH model it uses the conditional standard deviation instead of conditional variance. It is specified as in \@ref(eq:eq19).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1^+ \varepsilon_{t-1}^+ \beta_1^{-} + \varepsilon_{t-1}^{-}) + \beta_2 \sigma_{t-1}
 (\#eq:eq19)
\end{align}
```
\noindent where $\varepsilon_{t-j}^+$ is equal to $\varepsilon_{t-j}$ if the term is negative and equal to 0 if the term is positive. The reverse applies to $\varepsilon_{t-j}^-$. They cite @davidian1987 who find that using volatility instead of variance as scaling input variable gives better variance estimates. This is due to absolute residuals (contrary to squared residuals with variance) more closely predicting variance for non-normal distributions.

###### TSGARCH model

\noindent The absolute value Garch model or TS-Garch model, as named after @taylor1986 and @schwert1989, models the conditional standard deviation and is intuitively specified like a normal GARCH model, but with the absolute value of the shock term. It is specified as in \@ref(eq:eq20).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \left|\varepsilon_{t-1}\right|) + \beta_2 \sigma_{t-1}
 (\#eq:eq20)
\end{align}
```
\newpage

###### EWMA

\noindent An alternative to the series of GARCH models is the exponentially weighted moving average or EWMA model. This model calculates conditional variance based on the shocks from previous periods. The idea is that by including a smoothing parameter $\xi$ more weight is assigned to recent periods than distant periods. The $\xi$ must be less than 1. It is specified as in \@ref(eq:eq21).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\sigma_t^2 = (1-\xi) \sum\limits_{j=1}^\infty (\xi^j \varepsilon_{t-j}^2)
 (\#eq:eq21)
\end{align}
```
In practice a $\xi$ of 0.94 is often used, such as by the financial risk management company RiskMetrics$^{TM}$ model of J.P. Morgan [@morganguarantytrustcompany1996].

# Appendix to findings

#### Goodness of fit {#goodness-of-fit}

As already mentioned, next to testing the models in part \@ref(analysis), we also tested other models using the different distributions. This we did in order to check if distributions that capture the higher moment effects are really better in terms of goodness of fit. We did a small data mining experiment with 248 models that were estimated. This can ofcourse lead to overfitting if we from this list of models select the one with the lowest AIC for example. However, we can decide if there is a trend using the different distributions for the several GARCH models. Thus, in this experiment, our rule of thumb was to examine general trends. Six cases were examined. First, in figure \@ref(fig:aic1), symmetric GARCH with symmetric distributions are looked at. As you can see the student's t distribution (T) performs better than general error distribution (GED), that performs better than the normal distribution (NORM) according to both the AIC and BIC. Which is consistent with the literature that found that the assumption of the normal distribution is a rather poor assumption.

```{r aic1, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Goodness of fit symmetric GARCH and distributions', out.width='100%', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/aicfigures/symmetric aics.pdf")
```

First, in figure \@ref(fig:aic2), symmetric GARCH with the best symmetric distribution (T) and the other distributions (SGED, ST) are looked at. As you can see consistent with @giot2003 the skewed student's t (ST) distribution outperforms the symmetric distributions. It also outperforms in terms of goodness of fit the SGED.

```{r aic2, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Goodness of fit symmetric GARCH and other distributions', out.width='100%', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/aicfigures/symmetric aics2.pdf")
```

In figure \@ref(fig:aic3) you can see the same patter as in figure \@ref(fig:aic1), the student's t distribution performs best among the symmetric distributions.

```{r aic3, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Goodness of fit asymmetric GARCH and symmetric distributions', out.width='100%', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/aicfigures/asymmetric aics.pdf")
```

In figure \@ref(fig:aic4) the same patter arises as in figure \@ref(fig:aic2), the skewed student's t distribution again seems to be the most optimal one to use. Therefore the ST distribution is chosen as final model for the Euro Stoxx 50 index.
