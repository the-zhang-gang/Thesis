This paper examines the importance of higher-order moments in the estimation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value At Risk (CVaR). We use 5 limitations of the Skewed Generalized T-distribution SGT distributions: the SGED, the GED, the Skewed T (ST), the T and Normal distribution. We examine the performance of 8 GARCH models and observe that the skewed distributions SGED and ST are the best performing models in terms of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which is consistent with previous research for US indices. Using a rolling window approach for the out-of-sample (OOS) analysis we find that again this pattern appearing with the ST the best and the SGED a close second best distribution. Next to this, we also explore the Autoregressive Conditional Density model, which allows the higher-order moments to be time-varying (in contrast with constant skewness and kurtosis with GARCH models). The model in-sample provides a better fit according to the AIC, however the complexity of the estimation procedure is in our opinion not the best if we follow the results of our OOS. According to our OOS, we find that the ACD model with a Skewed T-distribution (ST) does not necessarily forecast the VaR and CVaR better than its non time-varying GARCH equivalent. Overall we do found that inclusion of higher-order moments matters in the estimation of VaR and CVaR.
