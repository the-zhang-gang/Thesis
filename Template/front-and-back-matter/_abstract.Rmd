This paper examines the importance of higher-order moments in the estimation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value At Risk (CVaR) for the European markets. We use 5 limited cases of the Skewed Generalized T-distribution SGT distributions: the SGED, the GED, the Skewed Student-t  (ST), the symmetric Student-t (T) and Normal distribution. We examine the performance of 8 commonly used GARCH models and observe that the skewed distributions SGED and ST are the best performing models in terms of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which is consistent with previous research on US indices. Using a rolling window approach for the out-of-sample (OOS) analysis we find that again this pattern appeared with the ST the best and the SGED a close second best distribution. Next to this, we also explore the Autoregressive Conditional Density (ACD) model, which allows the higher-order moments to be time-varying. The model in-sample provides a better fit according to the AIC, however the complexity of the estimation procedure is in our opinion not the best if we follow the results of our OOS. According to our OOS, we find that the ACD model with a Skewed T-distribution (ST) does not necessarily forecast the VaR and CVaR better than its non time-varying GARCH equivalent. Overall we do found that inclusion of higher-order moments matters in the estimation of VaR and CVaR.@
