First of all, many thanks to our families and loved ones that supported us during the writing of this thesis. Secondly, thank you professors Zhang ^[https://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/nl/faculty/hairui-zhang], Annaert^[https://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/nl/faculty/jan-annaert] and De Ceuster^[https://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/nl/faculty/marc-de-ceuster] for the valuable insights during courses you have given us in preparation of this thesis, the dozens of assignments using the R language and the many questions answered this year. We must be grateful for the classes of R programming by prof Zhang.  \

\noindent Secondly, we have to thank the developer of the software we used for our thesis. A profuse thanks to Allaire, the founder and CEO of [RStudio](http://rstudio.com). Thanks for making data science easier, more accessible and fun. We must also be grateful to the inventors of "Markdown", "Pandoc", "knitr", "bookdown", "thesisdown". Then, we must say thanks to [Ulrik Lyngs](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ulrik.lyngs/) who made it a bit easier to work together in R with a pre-build template for the university of Oxford, also without which this thesis could not have been written in this format [@lyngsOxforddown2019].  \

\noindent Finally, we thank [Alexios Ghalanos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexios-galanos-64309165/) for making the implementation of GARCH models integrated in R via his package "rugarch". By doing this, he facilitated the process of understanding the whole process and doing the analysis for our thesis.  \
