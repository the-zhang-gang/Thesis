First of all, we want to acknowledge the support during the writing of this thesis, given to us by our families and loved ones. Secondly, we are gratefull to our professors Jan Annaert^[https://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/nl/faculty/jan-annaert], Marc De Ceuster^[https://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/nl/faculty/marc-de-ceuster] and Hairui Zhang^[https://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/nl/faculty/hairui-zhang] for all the valuable insights during our courses at AMS and dozens of assignments using the R language. We are especially gratefull that they patiently answered all our questions throughout the year. \

\noindent Secondly, we want to extend our appreciation to [Ulrik Lyngs](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ulrik.lyngs/) who made it easier to work together in R with a pre-build template for the university of Oxford, without which this thesis could not have been written in this format [@lyngsOxforddown2019].  \

\noindent Finally, we thank [Alexios Ghalanos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexios-galanos-64309165/) for making the implementation of GARCH models integrated in R via his package "rugarch". By doing this,he facilitated the quantitative analysis we did in our methodology.  \
